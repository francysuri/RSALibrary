This Library allows you to generate signatures, verify signatures, encrypt and decrypt using
the RSA Algorithm.

All (even "signature" and "message") arguments to the functions must be decimals.
Hex and Binary are NOT supported.

I originally made this Library for Signature-Checking, but you can also use this for decryption, 
encryption, etc.
Ignore the "publicExponent" and "privateExponent", imagine them being just "exponent"


The library was compiled for iOS 5.0, I don't know whether it works on iOS 4.

I also didn't check whether this Library is arm-only or also works in the Simulator, sorry for that.

Finally a simple example on verifying a signature:

NSLog("Original Data: %@", [RSALibrary verifySignature:@"762" publicExponent:@"17" modulus:@"2773"]);


This will "decrypt" the signature and give it back as String which can be used to check the
signed data.

I hope I explained it good enough, if you have any questions feel free to contact me.
